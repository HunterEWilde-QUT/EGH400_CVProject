1. 	"Init" folder contains files having the initial positions of our method which requires 5 consecutive frames.
	If your method only requires the first frame, please ignore others.
	The other zip files contain a sequence of images for each dataset.
2.	The init file contains first line with the number of initial frames and the starting frame.
	Each of the following lines contains 5 numbers which are top left (x1,y1), bottom right (x2,y2), and rotation (r)
	Please notice that, here only the sequence "Person" has a different starting frame which is 15 (instead of 0).
3.	If the initial rectangle is not suitable to your algorithm, i.e. it is too loose or too tight, please feel free to edit it. 
	The evaluation will be based on the center of the object. 
4.	Please help me to output the rectangle of the object in every frame to a text file.


Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.

Best,
